# linear Regression Training project : Water Dam energy production 
In this project, we will use Linear Regression to predicate energy production for a water dam with target variable Energy_Production (MW) and 
The features are:
- Water_Flow_Rate (m³/s)
- Head (meters)
- Turbine_Efficiency (%)
- Generator_Efficiency (%)
- Reservoir_Level (meters)
- Gate_Opening (%)
- Ambient_Temperature (°C)
- Barometric_Pressure (mbar)
